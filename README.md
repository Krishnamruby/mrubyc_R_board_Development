## 📝 Overview

This repository contains example projects and documentation for using the [mruby/c](https://github.com/mrubyc/mrubyc) interpreter with the R Board. The initial example demonstrates how to blink an LED using Ruby code, making embedded development more accessible and expressive.

## ✨ Features

- Integration of mruby/c with the R Board (PIC32)
- LED blinking example project
- Pin mapping reference diagram
- Lightweight and efficient for embedded systems

## 🔧 Requirements

- R Board (PIC32-based development board)
